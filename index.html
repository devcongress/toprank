        <h1>TopRank.</h1>
        <p>TopRank is a hideout for programmers. Our system creates a continuous environment that provides the right mix of
        freedom and responsibility, support and challenge, necessary for the programmer to significantly improve their craft.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="ambition info--card container">
        <h1>Ambition.</h1>
        <p>We believe opportunity and ambition is everywhere. What’s missing is a conducive environment. Our ambition is 
        to create the missing conducive environment that births new generations of developers solving local problems in 
        the most innovative ways.</p>
        <p>We also believe local businesses (and government) are unable to reach their maximum capacity because they are
        technically under-staffed. As such, our hackers are required to “volunteer” a year of their professional life at a
        local business or government agency.</p>

        <div class="requirements--text">
            <h1>Requirements for Participation.</h1>
            <p>We’re new, without funding, which means that at the moment we’re unable to take care of the unnecessary blockers that
            ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. Accept our sincerest apologies. We promise to tackle
            them one after the other as resources become available to us.</p>
            <p>To enroll in TopRank, you should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>be able to participate (no legal or geographic barriers)</li>
                <li>have been programming for at least 6 months</li>
                <li>have a system that lets you drive yourself to greater heights</li>
                <li>be able to financially support yourself during the program</li>
            </ul>

    <section class="learning info--card container">
        <h1>Learning will be self-driven.</h1>
        <p>TopRank is self-driven. During the duration of the program hackers can work individually, 
            collaboratively, or both on projects that excite them. There will be some instructional 
            classes and assignments, but not enough to take away the freedom required to pursue 
            individual ambitions.</p>
